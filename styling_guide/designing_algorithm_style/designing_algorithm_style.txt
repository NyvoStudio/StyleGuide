NyvoStudio algorithm writing style guide :

    1. Important variables are shown with variable sign ( identifier-Value pair ) , do not use excessively : Variables are not a part of the algorithm

    2. Loop starting , finishing , changes in operations will be written In sqaure.

    3. Normal logical activites will be written In circle ( Not classes , unctions , ecorators )

    4. User inputs are shown in Hexagon shape.

    5. System decisions and exceptions will be written In rhombus.

    6. Functions will be written in triangles.

    7. Function calls be written In Call Activity Shape ( Yellow Square ).

    8. Connected attributes will be written In Page-refrences shape.

    9. Databases and class connections will be written In Database Shape.

    10. Connections will be refrenced With circlehead Lines.

    11. Imports and accesses will be Refrenced With Arrowhead Lines.

    12. Partitions will be shown In vertical Lines.

    13. Partition names will be shown in Horizontal lane.

    14. Comments will be sown In Comment_Alt shape.

    15. Numerical orderings will be written in brackets.

    16. All algorithms Must be written In visual paradigm online.
